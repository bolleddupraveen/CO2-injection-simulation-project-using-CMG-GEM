# CO2-injection-simulation-project-using-CMG-GEM
Numerical simulation of CO₂ injection for geological storage using CMG-GEM, focusing on pressure-controlled injection behavior, injection performance, and CO₂ dissolution analysis.

## Project Overview
This project presents a numerical simulation study of CO₂ injection for geological storage using the CMG-GEM compositional reservoir simulator. The objective is to evaluate injection performance, pressure-controlled injection behavior, and CO₂ dissolution characteristics in a deep saline reservoir.

The study focuses on understanding injection rate behavior under constant bottom-hole pressure control and assessing solubility trapping through CO₂ molality profiles.

## Software Used
- CMG-GEM (Compositional Reservoir Simulator)
- Microsoft Excel (Post-processing)
- LaTeX (Report preparation)

## Methodology
- Construction of a 3D compositional reservoir model
- Assignment of rock and fluid properties
- Gravity–capillary equilibrium initialization
- Pressure-controlled CO₂ injection through two injector wells
- Post-processing of simulation outputs using Excel

## Key Results
- Stable bottom-hole pressure maintained throughout injection
- Gradual decline in injection rate under pressure-controlled conditions
- Smooth increase in cumulative injected CO₂ volume
- Increased CO₂ molality with depth indicating solubility trapping
- Consistent injection performance across both wells
